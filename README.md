rust alternative to [ircdog](https://github.com/ergochat/ircdog)
because i did not feel like installing go

- automatically responds to irc `PING`s
- connects via tls (rustls) or plaintext
- can use an alternative cafile or disable tls verification entirely
- supports client certificate authentication
- can connect with a socks5 proxy to use tor
